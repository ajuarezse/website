# My Professional Website

This website, built from the ground up with React and Vite, is designed to showcase my skills and real-life projects. Visitors can explore my work, dynamically organized into two sections: Featured Projects and Other Projects. The application renders featured projects as larger, clickable images for emphasis, while other projects are displayed in a clean, grid-based layout. Each project includes links to live demos and code repositories.

# Key Features include:

- 🧭 **Header**: Includes anchor links for quick navigation to any section. The header hides while scrolling for a distraction-free experience.

- 🎥 **Main Section**: Features a dynamic typewriter effect that introduces visitors to the site author in an engaging way.

- 🖼️ **Projects**: Dynamically generated from a hard-coded array of project data, with clickable featured projects and a well-organized grid for the rest.

- 🔗 **Social Links**: Fixed to the side of the page for quick access, enabling visitors to connect with the author easily.

# Technologies and Tools Used:

- ⚛️ **React**: Leveraging React's component-based architecture for efficient UI development.

- ⚡ **Vite**: Used for the fast and efficient build process.

- 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language used in the project.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Carefully implemented to ensure the site looks great and functions seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Leveraged to organize and structure the code for scalability, reusability, and ease of maintenance.

- 🎨 **CSS**: Custom styling created from scratch to achieve a polished, modern look.

- 🌐 **Github**: Version control and hosting the live site.

# Future Plans

This is just the begining! In Stage 2, I plan to:

- Add an About Section to provide more context about me.
- Continue adding projects to the data array to keep the portfolio fresh and up-to-date.

Currently working on a blog section. Stay tuned!

    content: `
    <p>Hello and welcome to my first blog entry! This has been a long time coming—one of those ideas that’s been bouncing around in my head, and I’ve finally made it happen. Between coding, learning new algorithms, and refining my skills, I’ve now built my own blogging platform.</p>

<p>Writing has always been a personal exercise for me, a way to reflect and document my journey. I’ve kept journals to help untangle the mess of ideas constantly running through my mind. Seeing my thoughts laid out in words helps me organize them, make sense of them. It gives me the opportunity to, in a way, slow down and process the influx of information and events I experience.</p>

<p>At one point, I actually thought writing would be my career. I studied journalism and spent years contributing to school newspapers, from middle school through college. I loved the whole process—getting assignments, researching, conducting interviews, and eventually seeing my byline in print. That experience showed me the power of publishing, how writing can connect with people.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and I’m carving out a different path in tech. After completing a software engineering bootcamp, I built this portfolio site to showcase my work. And now, I’ve added a blog. The journalist in me is excited about this—an opportunity to sharpen my writing skills and share my journey.</p>

<p>I have to admit, after spending so much time writing code, it feels a little weird to type “normally” again. But there’s something refreshing about expressing myself beyond syntax and functions. In a way, it brings me closer to what I believe technology should be about—connecting people.</p>

<p>So, here I am, coding, building, and putting myself out there. If you’re reading this, thanks for being part of the journey. This first post is mostly a test run—making sure everything works and getting back into the rhythm of writing. But there’s more to come. Stay tuned!</p>

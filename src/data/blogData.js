    <p>Last Thursday, I may have found my new favorite hacker space. I attended a meetup hosted by Resident Electronic at Noisebridge, tucked away in the Mission District of San Francisco.</p>

    <p>Even just entering the space felt like an adventure. Walking down a dimly lit street to an unassuming metal gate, I wasn't entirely sure if I was in the right place. A faint glow of light escaped through the grates, with just enough background hum of sound to suggest that something interesting was happening inside. Suddenly, a voice from behind the gate reassured me: "You look confused. That means you're at the right place."</p>

    <p>That was my official welcome to Noisebridge.</p>

    <h2>First Impressions</h2>

    <p>Stepping through the gate, it was immediately clear that this was not a carefully polished, consumer-friendly venue. The outdoor patio was filled with half-finished projects, loose hardware, and a buzz of conversation among people who clearly knew each other well. To me, it felt like discovering a creative ecosystem in its rawest form: engineers, tinkerers, artists, and hackers building things for the love of it.</p>

    <p>As I made my way into the warehouse-like indoor space, I felt transported into another world. The lights on the main floor were low, giving the stage to electronic musicians and visual artists. The man who first let us in was now behind a table crowded with consoles, knobs, and switches, manipulating soundscapes that filled the room.</p>

    <p>Other artists, including Blu and Alon Onymous, took the stage as well, blending digital visuals with pulsing beats. The atmosphere was electric, and it was easy to get swept up in the sense of experimentation and creative freedom. And yet, I soon learned this was only the beginning of what Noisebridge had to offer.</p>

    <h2>The Second Floor: A World of Projects</h2>

    <p>In search of a restroom, I stumbled upon a staircase and followed it upward—like following Alice down the rabbit hole, but in reverse. The upstairs level opened up into another side of Noisebridge entirely: focused, industrious, and overflowing with possibilities.</p>

    <p>This floor was lined with makeshift workspaces, bookshelves stacked with computer science literature, and community areas for collaboration (or just grabbing a cup of coffee). Among the surprises were dedicated spaces for both music creation and crochet, an eclectic mix that reflects the community's openness to all kinds of making.</p>

    <p>One room especially caught my attention. Dimly lit, it held about seven people deeply focused on their laptops. Their concentration made me hesitant to interrupt, but it was obvious that serious projects were underway. It made me wonder about the many layers of creativity happening within those walls at any given time.</p>

    <h2>Learning Opportunities</h2>

    <p>As I chatted with a few friendly people, I learned about Noisebridge's weekly Python classes. That instantly intrigued me. Python has been high on my learning agenda, and apparently, these classes center around a hands-on group project that lives on GitHub—practical and collaborative, which is right up my alley.</p>

    <p>For someone like me who has been steadily building technical skills and seeking community, the idea of showing up here weekly to both learn and contribute feels like an ideal next step.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>I eventually had to leave to catch the train home, but I got the impression that many others would be there well into the night, coding, building, and experimenting. Noisebridge is more than just a space—it's a hub for ideas, collaboration, and exploration.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to return, dive into the Python classes, and contribute to this community. The night reminded me why I got into software development in the first place: the thrill of building, learning, and connecting with others who share the same passion.</p>

    <p>If you're reading this as a fellow technologist, a collaborator, or even a potential employer, know this: I'm always eager to learn, contribute, and take ownership of meaningful projects. If you're looking for a developer with full-stack skills, a drive to keep growing, and a genuine enthusiasm for building things that actually ship—I'd love to connect.</p>

      'From Cloud to Custom Domain: Engineering a Resilient Deployment for "What to Wear"',
    date: "July 28, 2025",
    excerpt:
      "A journey through cloud deployment challenges and engineering solutions for a full-stack application",
    heroImage: "/images/blog/post-4/WTWR.png",
    content: `
    <p>Bringing a full-stack application to life online is a thrilling endeavor, a complex orchestration of code, infrastructure, and configuration. The true test of a developer, however, often lies in navigating the unforeseen challenges that arise post-deployment, particularly when initial solutions hit unexpected roadblocks.</p>

<p>This was precisely the journey I embarked on with "What to Wear" (WTWR), a React-based application I developed during my time at the TripleTen Software Developer program. WTWR is designed to streamline daily dressing decisions by integrating real-time weather data with a user's uploaded clothing collection. Users can securely sign up, sign in, and manage their garments, while the application dynamically filters and suggests appropriate attire based on current conditions. It's a practical application of front-end responsiveness and robust back-end logic.</p>

<h3>Initial Deployment: Leveraging Google Cloud and Facing the Free Tier Frontier</h3>

<p>My initial deployment of WTWR leveraged Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This provided invaluable hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, demonstrating how to deploy a comprehensive application, manage resources, and ensure it was live and accessible. It was an excellent introduction to the power and scalability of cloud services.</p>

<p>However, a common hurdle soon emerged: the expiration of the free trial. With the trial's end, the services hosting WTWR were suspended, effectively taking the application offline. This presented a clear technical challenge: how to re-establish the application's online presence, ensuring its availability and functionality, without relying on cost-prohibitive proprietary solutions.</p>

<h3>Engineering a Sustainable Solution: Vercel, MongoDB Atlas, and a Custom Domain</h3>

<p>My objective was to find a robust, cost-effective, and independent hosting solution that would provide long-term stability for WTWR. This led me to a deep dive into alternative deployment strategies, ultimately converging on a powerful and flexible new architecture.</p>

<p>I strategically chose Vercel to host both the React front-end and the Express.js back-end. Vercel's intuitive platform and generous free tier made it an ideal candidate for continuous integration and deployment. For the database, I opted for MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database service, which offered a scalable and secure solution that integrated seamlessly with my back-end.</p>

<p>The migration process involved several key engineering steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Reconfiguration: Adapting the front-end to communicate with the newly deployed back-end on Vercel.</li>
  <li>Database Migration & Integration: Setting up the MongoDB Atlas cluster and ensuring the back-end correctly connected and interacted with the database.</li>
  <li>Environment Variable Management: Securely handling API keys and sensitive information across the new hosting environments.</li>
  <li>Custom Domain Integration: Configuring a custom subdomain through my portfolio website, ensuring a professional and memorable URL for the application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Commitment to Problem-Solving and Technical Excellence</h3>

<p>Successfully migrating and re-deploying "What to Wear" wasn't just about changing platforms; it was a comprehensive exercise in problem identification, strategic planning, and meticulous execution. It showcased my ability to adapt to new technical landscapes, optimize for performance and cost, and implement best practices for security and maintainability.</p>

<p>I thrive on these kinds of technical challenges—analyzing a problem, researching effective solutions, and meticulously implementing them to achieve a resilient and functional outcome. If you're tackling a complex software project or need an experienced hand in navigating deployment and infrastructure challenges, I'm eager to connect and contribute. Let's build robust and reliable solutions, together.</p>

      "Exploring emerging technologies and meaningful connections at TECHSPO San Francisco",
    heroImage: "/images/blog/post-3/MeTechspo.webp",
    content: `
    <p>This week, I attended TECHSPO San Francisco 2025, held at the Grand Hyatt at SFO — a two-day conference where developers, marketers, and tech innovators come together to showcase emerging technologies in AdTech, MarTech, SaaS, mobile, and beyond.</p>

<p>While I opted for the free pass this time around, I still walked away with meaningful conversations, fresh insights, and a deeper appreciation for how tech and creativity intersect. I'm always looking for ways to stay sharp, expand my network, and get exposure to the kinds of tools and ideas shaping our industry.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/post-3/LanyardTechspo.webp" alt="In front of the Hyatt SFO sign with my TECHSPO lanyard" class="blog-image" />

<p>I took the BART train all the way to SFO and rode the connecting tram over to the Hyatt where the event was being held. The moment I checked in and received a personalized lanyard, it all started to feel very real. The staff were welcoming, and even from the lobby, I could sense the energy of innovation buzzing around. The expo floor had a small but focused group of exhibitors, and I made it a point to engage with every booth I could.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, I had several memorable conversations that shaped my experience. I spoke with the team at Northbeam, a marketing analytics company that helps businesses understand where their traffic is actually coming from. In a world of fragmented user journeys and data overload, tools like this feel essential — and it was exciting to learn how they visualize and present that information for better decision-making.</p>

<p>Next, I connected with folks from Youvico, a video editing platform built for teams. They gave me a quick demo of their interface and walked me through features designed for remote collaboration. The live editing and review tools caught my eye — a reminder that tech isn't just about code; it's also about creativity and communication.</p>

<p>One of the more unexpected moments of the day came from meeting two young developers visiting from South Korea. They weren't exhibitors, but they eagerly showed me a video of a robot they're building. It looked incredibly advanced, and they were genuinely curious to hear my feedback. I really appreciated their enthusiasm and openness. It was a reminder of how innovation and curiosity can cross language and cultural barriers — even in the middle of a hotel lobby.</p>

<h3>Insights & Inspiration</h3>

<img src="/images/blog/post-3/PresentationTechspo.webp" alt="The main stage at TECHSPO San Francisco 2025" class="blog-image" />

<p>In between conversations, I sat in on several panel discussions and speaker sessions. Topics ranged from tech marketing to the future of AI and automation. But one message really stood out — and stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>One speaker emphasized how important it is to stand out in a world filled with AI-generated content. Her point was clear: if we want to be noticed, we need to lead with creativity, originality, and a human touch.</blockquote>

<p>That insight came from Sarah Fruy, a seasoned marketing executive based in Oakland. Her talk really resonated with me, and I was lucky enough to speak with her one-on-one shortly after. She was incredibly generous with her time and insights. That conversation left me even more motivated to lean into what makes me me — not just as a developer, but as a communicator, problem-solver, and lifelong learner.</p>

<p>Would I have loved to see more booths? Sure. More startups showing off cool tech? Absolutely. But overall, TECHSPO SF 2025 was a great reminder of the value of showing up — staying curious, making real connections, and keeping your skills sharp.</p>

      "A journey to Oakland's Sudo Room reveals surprising connections between web development and 3D printing",
    heroImage: "/images/blog/post-2/Hardware Hack Night ScreenShot.webp",
    content: `
    <p>Stepping beyond the familiar glow of my code editor, I recently embarked on a low-key adventure to a local hackerspace: the Sudo Room in Oakland, California. As a junior software developer navigating the path to my first full-time role, I've been advised to "get out there" and connect with the broader tech ecosystem. I figured exploring a place like this might just offer some fresh perspective, or at the very least, an interesting story.</p>

<p>I hopped on my bike and rode over, making my way into a space that immediately captured my curiosity. It was a fascinating, almost organic collection of electronics: rows of computer towers, the quiet hum of 3D printers, intricate synth consoles, and shelves brimming with every spare part imaginable. There was a library corner, audio/visual gear, and even classic sewing machines. But what truly brought the space to life was the palpable energy of people, from diverse walks of life, deeply engrossed in their own creations and fixes.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/post-2/Synth Station.webp" alt="Intricate synthesizer console at Sudo Room" class="blog-image" />

<p>Almost immediately, someone with a headlamp spotted me and, with a friendly grin, said, "Looks like your first time here!" I happily confirmed, and was then given a warm welcome and a tour. I saw a dedicated individual perfecting their craft on a sewing machine, a group collaborating on what looked like a sophisticated electronic Halloween prop, and even a family with kids engrossed in tinkering with an old laptop. The Sudo Room is clearly a hub for curious minds and hands-on creators.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/post-2/Testing Consoles.webp" alt="Testing consoles and electronic equipment at Sudo Room" class="blog-image" />

<p>The main focus of the evening seemed to be on a handful of donated 3D printers, each in various stages of revival. As my tour guide and I observed, a person working on one of the printers looked up and asked, "What does the Z coordinate do?" My guide initially thought it controlled vertical movement. Suddenly, my mind clicked. I immediately recalled the z-index in CSS, which controls the stacking order (how elements overlap on a screen), and I chimed in, "I think it actually controls forward and backward movement!"</p>

<img src="/images/blog/post-2/3D Printer.webp" alt="3D printer being repaired at Sudo Room" class="blog-image" />

<p>Both my guide and the printer operator paused, then agreed. With a few button presses on the touchscreen, the 3D printer's platform zoomed forward, confirming the hypothesis. It was a small moment, but incredibly satisfying – seeing a concept from my web development world (z-index for layering) find an unexpected, tangible parallel in hardware (the Z-axis for depth). It underscored how the core principles of problem-solving, spatial thinking, and logical progression are universal across different tech disciplines.</p>

<p>The Sudo Room truly impressed me as a space that fosters community, learning, and hands-on innovation. It's a testament to the fact that the tech world is vast and interconnected, and there's always something new to learn, build, or fix, regardless of your primary expertise. I'm already planning to bring some of my own projects there and look forward to connecting with more of the brilliant minds I met.</p>

    excerpt: "My First Blog Entry: A New Chapter",
    content: `
    <p>Hello and welcome to my first blog entry! This has been a long time coming—one of those ideas that’s been bouncing around in my head, and I’ve finally made it happen. Between coding, learning new algorithms, and refining my skills, I’ve now built my own blogging platform.</p>

<p>Writing has always been a personal exercise for me, a way to reflect and document my journey. I’ve kept journals to help untangle the mess of ideas constantly running through my mind. Seeing my thoughts laid out in words helps me organize them, make sense of them. It gives me the opportunity to, in a way, slow down and process the influx of information and events I experience.</p>

<p>At one point, I actually thought writing would be my career. I studied journalism and spent years contributing to school newspapers, from middle school through college. I loved the whole process—getting assignments, researching, conducting interviews, and eventually seeing my byline in print. That experience showed me the power of publishing, how writing can connect with people.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and I’m carving out a different path in tech. After completing a software engineering bootcamp, I built this portfolio site to showcase my work. And now, I’ve added a blog. The journalist in me is excited about this—an opportunity to sharpen my writing skills and share my journey.</p>

<p>I have to admit, after spending so much time writing code, it feels a little weird to type “normally” again. But there’s something refreshing about expressing myself beyond syntax and functions. In a way, it brings me closer to what I believe technology should be about—connecting people.</p>

<p>So, here I am, coding, building, and putting myself out there. If you’re reading this, thanks for being part of the journey. This first post is mostly a test run—making sure everything works and getting back into the rhythm of writing. But there’s more to come. Stay tuned!</p>
